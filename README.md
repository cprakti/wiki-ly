# wiki-ly

A wiki generator for a variety of groups built with Ruby on Rails, Javascript (AJAX/jQuery), Active Record, SQL database, and Bootstrap.

Wiki-ly allows users to create profiles, create groups, write articles, publish articles (but only if you're the admin), create tags for the articles, favorite articles, and search for articles, groups, & tags.  The application was built in 3 days with a team of four.
